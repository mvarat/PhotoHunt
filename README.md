# Photo Hunt #

#### Photo Hunt is a 10-level spot the difference game based on the popular touch-screen game commonly found in bars.

In each level, the player is shown two photos, side-by-side that are identical except for four differences. The objective is to find and identify the differences between the pictures before the timer runs out. The player selects potential differences by clicking on either picture in the location of the difference. Correct clicks create a blue circle around the difference and increase the player's score by 100 points while incorrect clicks deduct 15 points. If a level is completed, the player is awarded bonus points based on the time remaining. The amount of time the player has to find the differences decreases for each level making the game more challenging. The player is awarded 3 hints to use during the course of one game. When a hint is selected, a difference is made known to the player. The game ends when the time expires on any level. The player wins the game when the 10th level is completed.

## User Story ##

The player should be able to:
 1. Start the game at level one.
